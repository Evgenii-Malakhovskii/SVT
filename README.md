The aplication is deployed to https://svtrobotics-22.web.app/ 
There is no need setting the app up to run it. It is accessible via the link above.
App is written in Angular/Angular CLI/TS

The app's functionality 
1.Robots table is displayed.
2.The table is sortable by all attributes.
3.The table is filterable by robotId.

Bonus (Description of what features, functionality, etc. you would add next and how you would implement them.)

First of all I would add features, functionality which brings me passive income!
There are couple of them:
1) Login Authentication functionality
2) Paid subscription and renew
3) Adding/Deleting a new robot
4) Updating "x" , "y" coordinates
5) Adding "z" coordinate
6) Adding a link that will display a robot's locatin on a map.
